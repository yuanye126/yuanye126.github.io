[Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model for ex-ante detection of cybercrimes on the Ethereum blockchain][(https://www.fa.mgt.tum.de/entfin/entfin-2024-conference/](https://pypi.org/project/gcn-trainer/0.1.0/))
The code implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to classify cybercriminal and non-cybercriminal addresses on the Ethereum blockchain, using ATGraph technology. Our approach uses several on-chain input features for classification. It builds on [Hornuf, Momtaz, Nam, and Ye (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426625000391). and is designed to perform well in samples of limited size.
