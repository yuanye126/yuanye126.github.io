excerpt: 'Information asymmetries shape the (in)efficiency of entrepreneurial finance markets. We introduce a distinction between information-endowment asymmetry (unequal access to signals) and information-utilization asymmetry (unequal processing of signals). Our study explores whether the onset of generative artificial intelligence (AI) improves signal conversion efficiency in entrepreneurial finance; i.e., the effective utilization of the information endowment. Empirically, we engineer an AI agent that utilizes the information endowment in blockchainbased crowdfunding campaigns to generate investment recommendations, and compare those to recommendations by human experts and a human-built recommendation algorithm. Among all major signals of capital formation in blockchain-based crowdfunding, our AI agent's advice outperforms statistically and economically: Including our AI agent's advice as a signal for capital formation raises R-squared by up to 35%, and a one-standard-deviation increase in AI recommendation strength is associated with 48% higher funding amounts. Explainable AI in the form of Shapley values corroborates AI's superior predictive power. Consistent with our signal conversion efficiency conjecture, we also find that AI-human advice congruence is positively associated with capital formation, while AI-human advice divergence predicts lower funding amounts if investment recommendations by humans are more optimistic than those by AI, highlighting the practical potential of AI as a corrective device for human biases in investment decisions.'
